📊 Data Analytics Project
📌 Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow, starting from loading raw data in Python to delivering insights through a Power BI dashboard, a written report, and a presentation created using Gamma.
The goal is to analyze the dataset, extract meaningful insights, and present them in a clear and decision-friendly manner.

📂 Dataset

The dataset contains structured data relevant to the analysis (CSV format).

It is loaded and processed using Python.

Due to size limitations, the dataset is not uploaded to the repository.

You can place the dataset inside the data/ folder before running the project.

🛠 Tools & Technologies

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

PostgreSQL (SQL queries & analysis)

Power BI (Interactive dashboard)

Gamma (Presentation / PPT)

Jupyter Notebook

VS Code

🔄 Project Steps

Data Loading

Imported the dataset into Python using Pandas.

Performed initial inspection and understanding of the data.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed data distributions, trends, and patterns.

Used visualizations to identify insights and anomalies.

Data Cleaning

Handled missing values.

Removed duplicates.

Corrected data types and inconsistencies.

SQL Analysis

Loaded cleaned data into PostgreSQL.

Wrote SQL queries to answer key business questions.

Extracted aggregated and filtered insights.

Dashboard Creation

Built an interactive Power BI dashboard.

Included KPIs, charts, and filters for easy analysis.

Reporting & Presentation
